**stella** is the multi-platform mail sending system to manage mail magazine.
This system was formerly managed via **stella-mail.com**, but is temporarily suspended now.

## Concept

![stella topboard](https://github.com/ryoxsakai/stella/blob/master/topboard.png?raw=true)

The concepts of this service are the following:
- The lowest price mail magazine platform
- Support a lot of devices with the responsible layouts
- Target is the generation of 10s and 20s so that UIs are very colorful and user-friendly

The system collected the money via **Webpay API**.
This API supported **Credit Card** use (and supported either **Visa** or **Master Card**).
The subscription systems like this site maintain the good-fluided cashflow.
Users paid monthly via their credit cards.
